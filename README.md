# About

Annotated solutions to the Kotlin Koans.

# Contents

The Koans problems are split into 6 sections:

1. Introduction
2. Collections
3. Conventions
4. Properties
5. Builders
6. Generics

Each section has a handful of problems. The task is to fill in the code in `Task.kt` to be able to get all tests to pass.
